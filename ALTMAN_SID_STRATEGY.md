# The Altman SID Strategy
**What Sam Altman Would Do With SID**  
*Ship fast, iterate faster, dominate education*

---

## Phase 1: MVP in 30 Days (Ship or Die)
**"Perfect is the enemy of shipped"**

### Week 1-2: Core Only
- ✅ Slide bar (hover open/close) 
- ✅ Basic note editor
- ✅ Local storage (IndexedDB)
- ✅ One study tag: 🔴 CRITICAL
- ❌ Skip: Voice, AI, sync, fancy animations

### Week 3-4: Student Validation
- 🎯 Get 100 students using it daily
- 📊 Measure: session time, notes created, retention
- 🔄 Iterate based on actual usage, not features

**Altman Rule**: If students don't use it for 7 days straight, the product is wrong.

---

## Phase 2: Find Product-Market Fit (Months 2-6)
**"Do things that don't scale until you find what works"**

### The Concierge Approach
- 🏫 Partner with 3 universities manually
- 👨‍🏫 Personally onboard 50 professors
- 📞 Weekly calls with power users
- 🛠️ Build exactly what they ask for

### Metrics That Matter
- **Daily Active Students**: Target 1,000
- **Professor NPS**: Target >70
- **Study Session Length**: Target >20 min
- **Week 2 Retention**: Target >60%

### Features to Add (Based on User Screams)
1. **Export to PDF** (professors demand this)
2. **Simple sharing** (students share notes constantly)
3. **Mobile PWA** (they study on phones)
4. **Basic search** (they lose their notes)

## Phase 3: Scale the Engine (Months 6-18)
**"Hire the best, automate everything, expand fast"**

### Team Structure (Altman Style)

### 2. Hire Slow, Fire Fast

- **Diverse perspectives** (different learning styles, backgrounds)

### 3. Fundraise Like a Pro

- **Series A** ($15M): Scale to 100K students
- **Series B** ($50M): International expansion + AI
- **Growth Rounds**: Dominate global education market

### 4. Think 10x, Not 10%
- **10x better study outcomes** (not just prettier notes)
- **10x faster learning** (AI-optimized study paths)
- **10x more accessible** (works for every learning style)
- **10x cheaper** (democratize premium education)

## What Altman Would NOT Do

❌ **Perfect the slide animation** for 6 months  
❌ **Build enterprise features** before students love it  
❌ **Worry about competitors** (focus on users)  
❌ **Over-engineer** the architecture  
❌ **Hire consultants** instead of builders  
❌ **Pivot too early** (give it 6 months minimum)  
❌ **Ignore unit economics** (know your LTV/CAC)
